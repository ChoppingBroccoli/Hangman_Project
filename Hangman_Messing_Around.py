### PSEUDO CODE ###

First,  check if the user has more than 14 lives. If True, randomly select a word
from words_list. If False, game ends.

If the user has more than 14 lives remaining, ask the user to guess one of
the letters in random_word. If they guess a letter correctly then update word_with_dashes
with the user_guess. If they guess incorrectly, update word_with_dashes with a '-'.

Ask the user for another guess then evaluate until all letters have been guessed.
